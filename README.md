# AI-storytelling-for-kids

During the meeting at Hackgarden in 05/01/2023, we created this digital interactive book-experience for kids.
The idea was using the webcam to recognize some drawings on paper and start generate stories using chat GPT.

For the input, we used the Teachable Machine to train our model with a deck of cards:

Then, we exported our model in Keras file with the 6 classes.
