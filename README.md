# AI-storytelling-for-kids

During the meeting at [Hackgarden](https://www.meetup.com/hackergarten-luzern/) on 05/01/2023, we created this digital interactive book-experience for kids.
The idea was using a webcam to recognize some drawings on paper and start generating stories using [chatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat).

For the input, we used [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) to train our model with a deck of seed drawings. 

Then, we exported our model in Keras file with the 6 classes.
